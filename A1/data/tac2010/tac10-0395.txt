Some 211,000 pounds of steak products are being recalled because the packages don't disclose that they may contain the allergens buttermilk and whey. 

The products being recalled by Advance Food Co. Inc. of Enid, Okla., were distributed to stores throughout the United States and Puerto Rico,the Agriculture Department said Thursday. They are labeled ``Steak for Country Frying -- Fully Cooked Cubed Beef Steak'' and sold in 2 1/2-pound packages. ``Est. 2260Y'' appears inside the USDA inspection mark. 

The recall applies to packages that don't carry the phrase ``Buttermilk Blend (Buttermilk, Whey)'' in the ingredient statement. The recalled packages are marked with the letter D followed by any four-digit number, or one of these specific numbers, E0012, E0071, E0141, E0191. E0221, E0251, E0261 or E0311. 

``Because of the potential hazard for people with milk and whey allergies, we urge those consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers,'' said Thomas J. Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
