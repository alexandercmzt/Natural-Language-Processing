Hurricane Floyd has chased PBS's ``Nightly Business Report'' from its studio. 

The financial news show originates from WPBT in Miami and is broadcast on most PBS stations on weekdays. But WPBT's offices were closed Tuesday because of the approaching hurricane. 

Tuesday's show was to originate instead from New York, where ``Nightly Business Report'' generally has a reporter in a studio each night.
