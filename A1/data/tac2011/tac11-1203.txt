A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with another vessel in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday and leaked about 15,000 tons of crude oil, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said. 

The collision left three holes in the 146,000-ton tanker Hebbei Spirit, leading to the leak, a ministry official said.
