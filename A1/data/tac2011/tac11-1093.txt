A violent offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement claimed responsibility Monday for the suicide attack in the southern Israeli town of Dimona. 

In an e-mail to The Associated Press, the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade said it carried out the "martyrdom operation in Dimona." The faction said it would provide further details later.
