The European Commission said Friday it was releasing 1.5 million euros (2.2 million dollars) in emergency relief aid to Bangladesh after a powerful cyclone killed at least 243 people in the country. 

"Preliminary indications are that the most pressing needs will be food, safe drinking water, emergency shelter, clothing blankets and medicine," Commission spokesman John Clancy told journalists in Brussels. 

Cyclone Sidr pounded Bangladesh late Thursday with winds of 220-240 kilometres (140-155 miles) an hour and torrential rains, wiping out homes and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee for their lives.
