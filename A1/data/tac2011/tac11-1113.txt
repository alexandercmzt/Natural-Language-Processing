The official Xinhua News Agency says 178 schoolchildren from one school have been confirmed dead in earthquake-hit Sichuan province. 

Xinhua says the children were confirmed dead Wednesday in Qingchuan in northern Sichuan. 

The report says the students were taking a nap when their three-story building collapsed in the powerful earthquake on Monday. Another 139 students escaped while 23 others are still missing.
