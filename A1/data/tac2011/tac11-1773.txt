O.J. Simpson is in custody in Florida and will be brought before a judge next week on allegations that he violated terms of his release on bail in a Las Vegas armed robbery case, a court official said. 

A hearing was scheduled Wednesday at the request of Clark County District Attorney David Roger, who was filing a motion Friday to revoke Simpson's bail, according to a clerk for District Court Judge Jackie Glass.
