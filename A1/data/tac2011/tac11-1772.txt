Two co-defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges Tuesday in the O.J. Simpson armed robbery case, agreeing to testify against Simpson and three others in the alleged hotel room theft of sports collectibles from two memorabilia dealers. 

"Guilty, sir," said Walter Alexander, who entered the plea to felony conspiracy to commit robbery. Charles Cashmore pleaded guilty to felony accessory to robbery during a separate arraignment minutes later. 

District Attorney David Roger agreed to drop charges including kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy against both men. Both men remained free pending sentencing.
