British bank HSBC, the world's third-biggest bank by market capitalisation, said on Monday it had exposure of about 1.0 billion dollars to suspected fraud by US financier Bernard Madoff. 

"In the interests of clarity, HSBC confirms that it has provided financing to a small number of institutional clients who invested in funds with Madoff," it said. 

"On the basis of information presently available, HSBC is of the view that the potential exposure under these financing transactions is in the region of one billion US dollars (740 million euros)."
