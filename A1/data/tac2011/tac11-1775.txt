Both sides have rested in the O.J. Simpson kidnapping and armed robbery case after a last-minute dispute threatened to derail the trial. 

Judge Jackie Glass dismissed jurors for the day Wednesday. They are due to hear final arguments Thursday. 

Glass rejected mistrial motions earlier but expressed concern that the trial was in jeopardy and said she was trying "to get this case back on track." 

Prosecutors and defense lawyers thought the lead detective blurted out that a defense witness had been thrown out of a hearing for tampering with a witness. 

But the judge found that the detective was referring to someone else.
